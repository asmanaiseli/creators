      Knitting creates stitches:
       <br>loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round
       <br>(tubular). There are usually many active stitches on the knitting needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the
       <br> next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled 
       <br>through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that 
       <br>the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.
      
      Differences in yarn (varying in fibre type, weight, uniformity and twist), 
      <br>needle size, and stitch type allow for a variety of knitted fabrics with different properties, including color, texture, thickness, heat retention, water
      <br> resistance, and integrity. A small sample of knitwork is known as a swatch..</big></p><big>
